#summary A tiny library to log Arduino data into SD cards.

= Introduction =

This library has been developed to provide arduino projects with a library to log data into SD cards. It is based in another similar project, SD_uFAT by David Cuartielles, but we tried to focus in three main goals: easy use, high speed and small size.
This is going to be used as part of another project that's being developed by Raul Hevia, a GPS data logger that will be used in FPV (First Person View) RC planes.
